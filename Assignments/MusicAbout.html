      <h1>Music Library Connect</h1>
      <p>This wifi gives you access to the Irving S. Gilmore Music Library at Yale database. By connecting to this library, you've already contributed to the community, with your recommendation of a song. You and the others are now connected through this shared playlist. In a library, so silent you could hear the drop of a pin, you can now engage with one another through music.

      On a daily basis, new music facts about the Irving S. Gilmore specific Music Library at Yale and random facts about music today will appear. The goal is to not only connect people through music, but assist them in learning more about it. In addition to that, we hope to highlight the music knowledge filled in the Irving S. Gilmore specific Music Library at Yale.</p>
