  <p> I think the concept of databases and the internet is interesting. In many ways, participation in the internet is taxed by websites and entities requesting our data for access into their services. It's interesting to think about how much data is floating around in the internet. Like in the Ashley Madison case, this data could destroy our lives and repaint pictures of us in ways we hope don't fully define us. The amount of data that has been collected on us individuals is enough to destroy us economically and socially, but we still participate. It's almost as if everyone has accepted the risk involved because others are doing so. And there is a fear of missing out on the the information the great internet has to hold. Overall, I think it's very interesting the transition to being very private to willingly giving up information to these websites and entities as a prerequisite for participation.</p>
